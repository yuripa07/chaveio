## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

#### Google OAuth sign-in
- Users sign in with Google via `arctic` (PKCE). Session persisted in an `HttpOnly` `chaveio_session` cookie (30d, HS256 via `jose`) signed with the new `SESSION_SECRET`.
- New routes: `GET /api/auth/google/start`, `GET /api/auth/google/callback`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/auth/me`.
- Short-lived signed `chaveio_oauth_flow` cookie carries OAuth `state` + PKCE verifier + allowlisted `returnTo` (5 min TTL). No new DB table.
- New libraries: `src/lib/session.ts`, `src/lib/oauth.ts`, `src/lib/oauth-flow-cookie.ts`. `lib/api-utils.ts` gains `handleUserRequest()` alongside the existing `handleRequest()`.

#### User model and two-token architecture
- New `User` model (`googleSub` unique, email, name, avatarUrl, locale, `tier = FREE`, `lastLoginAt`). Future-proof for profiles, history, and premium.
- `Tournament` adds `authMode` (`PASSWORD` | `GOOGLE`, default `PASSWORD` for backward compatibility) and nullable `creatorUserId`. `passwordHash` relaxed to nullable.
- `Participant` adds nullable `userId` with `@@unique([tournamentId, userId])` (Postgres treats NULLs as distinct, so legacy rows coexist).
- Additive migration `add_google_auth` — zero required changes on existing rows.

#### Tournament creation and join flow
- All new tournaments are created in `GOOGLE` mode. Creator form no longer collects name or password — identity comes from the session.
- `POST /api/tournaments/[code]/join` branches on `authMode`: `GOOGLE` requires a session and auto-links the `Participant`; `PASSWORD` keeps the legacy `{displayName, password}` body unchanged.
- Display-name collisions on Google joins are resolved deterministically (`" 2"`, `" 3"`, …).
- `GET /api/tournaments/[code]/check` now also returns `authMode` so the lobby can pick the right UI before prompting.

#### Protect-with-Google (legacy linking)
- New `POST /api/tournaments/[code]/link-google`: a participant in a `PASSWORD` tournament re-enters the tournament password once to bind their Google account. After linking, password-only login for that displayName is rejected with 401 "This participant is protected with Google…".
- Frontend CTA appears in the lobby when signed in + current participant is unlinked.

#### Frontend
- `UserProvider` context + `useUser()` hook (`src/contexts/user-context.tsx`) mounted in the root layout.
- `GoogleSignInButton` component (full-page anchor — carries `Set-Cookie` on redirect). Primary/secondary variants.
- `UserChip` component: header avatar + sign-out dropdown.
- Landing page (`/`) gates "Create tournament" on authentication and surfaces OAuth errors via `?auth_error=`.
- Tournament lobby (`/tournament/[code]`) branches on `authMode` + session state: Google auto-join, password form, or protect-with-Google CTA.

#### i18n
- New `auth` namespace in `src/locales/translations.ts` (pt-BR + en).
- New English `apiErrors` for session + linking rejections, translated in pt-BR (`"Sign in required…"`, `"This participant is protected with Google…"`, etc.).

#### Docs
- New `docs/auth.md` — two-token model, OAuth flow diagram, linking flow, legacy guarantees, out-of-scope list.
- `AGENTS.md`, `docs/backend-conventions.md`, `docs/frontend-conventions.md`, `docs/i18n.md` updated for `handleUserRequest`, `UserContext`, `GoogleSignInButton`, `authMode`, and the new routes/env vars.

#### Testing
- Unit: `session.test.ts`, `oauth-flow-cookie.test.ts`.
- Integration: `auth/me.test.ts`, `auth/logout.test.ts`, `auth/google-callback.test.ts`, `join-google.test.ts`, `link-google.test.ts`; `tournaments.test.ts` and `check.test.ts` expanded for the new session gate and `authMode` response.
- `tests/integration/fixtures.ts` gains `createUserAndSession`, `createGoogleTournament`, `joinTournamentWithGoogle`, `linkGoogleToParticipant`. Legacy PASSWORD-mode fixture rewritten to a direct Prisma insert so pre-existing tests remain untouched.

### Security
- `/link-google` honors the two-case auth test rule (returning-user-wrong-password **and** first-time-user-wrong-password both 401).
- Session cookies are `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` in production. `SameSite=Lax` is intentional so the OAuth callback carries the cookie back.

### Internal
- New dependency: `arctic` (Google OAuth + PKCE).
- `SESSION_SECRET` env var (distinct from `JWT_SECRET`) so either can be rotated independently.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-04-12

### Added

#### Internationalization (i18n)
- Full pt-BR / English translation support via `LocaleProvider` and `useLocale()` hook
- Translation files for all UI strings in `src/locales/translations.ts`
- `LocaleSwitcher` component (fixed bottom-right pill) with PT/EN language toggle
- API error messages standardized to English; translated on the frontend via `translateApiError()`
- i18n guide documented in `docs/i18n.md`

#### Dark Mode / Theme Toggle
- Light / Dark / System theme support via `ThemeProvider` and `useTheme()` context
- Theme toggle integrated into `LocaleSwitcher` pill (Sun / Moon / Monitor icons)
- Dark mode variants applied across all pages and components

#### Drag-and-Drop Bracket Reordering
- Tournament creator can reorder bracket candidates in the lobby via drag-and-drop
- `PATCH /api/tournaments/[code]/items/order` endpoint to persist new seed order
- Reordering is blocked once any participant has submitted picks
- `SortableBracketItem` and `ReorderableSlotItem` components using `@dnd-kit`

#### Kick Participant
- Creator can remove participants at any time (lobby, active, finished)
- `DELETE /api/tournaments/[code]/participants/[id]` endpoint; participant's picks cascade-delete
- `KickParticipantDialog` with full accessibility: ARIA roles, focus trap, Escape key, click-outside dismiss
- Kick button available in both lobby and live pages

#### Bracket Champion Column
- SVG bracket now shows a champion column to the right of the final with a trophy icon
- Predicted champion is hidden on the results page until the final match is resolved

#### Auth Guard
- `useRequireParticipant()` hook protects all participant-only pages from infinite loading when unauthenticated
- `resolveAuthGuardStatus()` pure function with `AuthGuardStatus` discriminated union in `src/lib/auth-guard.ts`

#### New Components
- `ParticipantAvatar` — circular avatar with participant initial (indigo theme)
- `SectionHeader` — icon + uppercase label + optional count (used in lobby)
- `KickParticipantDialog` — accessible kick confirmation modal

### Fixed

- Late joiners (participants who join mid-tournament) can now make picks starting from their join round, even when some matches in that round are already complete
- Auth guard no longer causes infinite loading spinner on protected pages when the user is unauthenticated
- Predicted champion column hidden on results page until the final is resolved
- Bracket champion column connector correctly aligned with the final match
- `LocaleSwitcher` pill redesigned; removed indigo shadows from dark mode bracket
- All API error messages converted to English for consistent frontend translation
- Form field labels and error messages fully translated to pt-BR
- Items label renamed from "Participantes" to "Candidatos" in tournament creation
- Lobby CTA shows "Editar palpites" when picks have already been submitted

- `src/lib/auth-guard.ts` — pure auth guard status resolver

- `src/contexts/locale-context.tsx` and `src/contexts/theme-context.tsx` added
